# internship-analysis

This project aims to measure the experiences of interns across its several anonymized technology companies. We want to identify intern objectives and determining how comprehensively internships fulfilled them. 

Specifically, these are the question we are most interested in answering: 
-	How did Company A internship compare to other internships this summer?
-	How did the experiences of Company A's fully remote interns differ from interns that had a hybrid internship model?
-	How do ratings of Company A's internship experience differ by race & gender?

Understanding these critical points will provide insights to the talent acquisition team to adjust and improve their internship experiences for the future.
